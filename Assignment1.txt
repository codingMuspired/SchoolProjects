 Assignment: Assignment 1 - String Manipulation
 Description:
    This assignment requires the usage of the string class to receive a first
    and last name from a user. The program then assigns the name to a third
    string names fullName. The fullName is displayed with a white space between
    the names. The length as well as upper lower case variations are also 
    displayed. The second portion of the assignment requires the usage of the
    Decimal Format Class. The user is asked for an input between two static
    variables to three decimal places and then the variable is returned rounded
    and to the format required using the decimal format class.
